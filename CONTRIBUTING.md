# Contributing
*Scroll down for feature requests.*<br>
All contributions are welcome, but here are some things you need to check before opening a pull request:<br>
These are for **adding** features:
* __Working__<br>
Download, clone or copy the 'app' folder in this repository, make your changes and test them.<br>
* __Useful__<br>
Before opening the pull request, make sure that if you're adding something, it will be useful.<br>
It can be useful for only 10% of people, but as long as it has a purpose, your pull request will be accepted.
* __Finished__<br>
Everything you add must be finished. This means that it works and does what you expect.<br>
For example, if you're adding a new widget, make sure the widget displays and after the pull request is accepted,
 only improvements can be done to the widget, not bug fixes or finishing it up.

**Removing** features:
Only delete things that are useless, or unused and are costing performance.<br>

**Improving** Features:
As long as it works and is an improvement, your pull request would probably be accepted.
# Feature Requests
If you don't use Python (meaning you wouldn't be able to pull request) and/or don't know how to implement a feature, but you want a feature added, just tell us in the discord server or an issue.
