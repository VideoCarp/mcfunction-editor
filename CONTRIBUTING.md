# Why Contribute?
By contributing anything, not necessarily code, even just bug reports or feature requests, you are ***helping the project*** a lot.
Not only that, but if it's a feature request, addition, or bug report you're getting that feature not only to yourself but to 
all other users of this project.
*If you're wondering how to contribute, scroll down below feature requests.*
All contributions are welcome, but here are some things you need to check before opening a pull request:<br>
These are for **adding** features:
* __Working__<br>
Download, clone or copy the 'app' folder in this repository, make your changes and test them.<br>
* __Useful__<br>
Before opening the pull request, make sure that if you're adding something, it will be useful.<br>
It can be useful for only 10% of people, but as long as it has a purpose, your pull request will be accepted.
* __Finished__<br>
Everything you add must be finished. This means that it works and does what you expect.<br>
For example, if you're adding a new widget, make sure the widget displays and after the pull request is accepted,
 only improvements can be done to the widget, not bug fixes or finishing it up.

**Removing** Features:<br>
Only delete things that are useless, or unused and are costing performance.<br>

**Improving** Features:<br>
As long as it works and is an improvement, your pull request would probably be accepted.
# Feature Requests
If you don't use Python (meaning you wouldn't be able to pull request) and/or don't know how to implement a feature, but you want a feature added, just tell us in the discord server or an issue.
# How to Contribute
This is probably unneeded, but often people don't contribute because they don't know how to.<br>
Firstly, I want to clarify contributing **isn't always adding or improving code**. Even issues and bug reports are contributions.<br>
Here's how to contribute:
For **pull requests**:
* Create a 'fork' of the repository, essentially copy it.
* Find the file you want to change.
* Press the pencil icon to edit it, and make your changes.
* Go out of the file and directory, to the main repository and press the green 'Create pull request' button.
For **issues**:
* Click on 'issues' near 'code' at the top, without forking.
* Click on the green 'New issue' button.
* Start typing.
