# MCFunction Editor
This is a ready-to-use but being worked on text editor for Minecraft commands.<br>
It is written in Python.
# Features:
* Syntax Highlighting
This editor has proper syntax highlighting for commands.
* Performance<br>
Although it's written in Python, this editor still only uses ~15 mb of memory a second after being opened.<br>
Comparing this to your average Electron hello world, it's ~10x more performant on the memory side.<br>
If enough people want better performance, I can/may write this in C++, meaning it will have much better performance.
* Small<br>
The text editor is relatively small compared to any others. The download size is very small and its lightweight.
* Easy Manipulation<br>
You can *easily* manipulate parts of the text editor by just configuring variables.
* Aimed at Commands<br>
This editor is aimed specifically for commands and mcfunction, nothing else meaning it's the main focus and will be richest.

None yet, but I'll get some.
